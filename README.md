# OmniFace: Multi-Attribute Classification System

OmniFace is a deep learning-based multi-attribute classification system for detecting and classifying human faces based on age, gender, and race. This project utilizes computer vision techniques and a multi-output neural network.

## Features

- Detects faces in images using a pre-trained face detection model.
- Predicts **age**, **gender**, and **race** attributes for detected faces.
- Multi-output neural network architecture with separate outputs for each attribute.
- Utilizes UTKFace and WIDER Face datasets for training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Install project dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Training the Model

1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/dataset` directory.
2. Run the `notebooks/training.ipynb` notebook to train the model.

### Evaluation

Use the `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb` to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

### Inference

To test the model on a custom image:
1. Place the image in a known directory (e.g., `/path/to/image.jpg`).
2. Run the `notebooks/inference.ipynb` notebook or execute the following script:
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

### Results

The model predicts:
- **Age:** An integer representing the estimated age.
- **Gender:** Male or Female.
- **Race:** One of the following categories: White, Black, Asian, Indian, or Other.

### Example Output
